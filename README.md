# faceRecognition

iOS app that is able to recognize faces once it sees them. Currently all memory is cleared once the session is over. Six faces of famous people are preinstalled. If the app sees an unknown face, it prompts to enter a name for it. Once the name is entered, the app later recognizes the face and prints the name on the view controller.
